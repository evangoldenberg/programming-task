Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected: {code} /test: get: responses: 200: schema: $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA' {code} However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme {code} /testSub: get: responses: 200: schema: type : 'string' format : 'com.ClassB' {code} However I'd expect it to be: {code} /testSub: get: responses: 200: schema: $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB' {code}","ASF GitHub Bot:1481727356:14/Dec/16 14:55: GitHub user bobpaulin opened a pull request:      https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348      CAMEL-10597 - Allow addition of x-className to empty VendorExtensions        You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:      $ git pull https://github.com/bobpaulin/camel CAMEL-10597  Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:      https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348.patch  To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch with (at least) the following in the commit message:      This closes #1348      ----  ---- | Bob Paulin:1481727366:14/Dec/16 14:56: PR included https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348 | Claus Ibsen:1481729518:14/Dec/16 15:31: Thanks for the PR | ASF GitHub Bot:1481729644:14/Dec/16 15:34: Github user bobpaulin closed the pull request at:      https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348 | Andrea Cosentino:1481810725:15/Dec/16 14:05: 2.17.x is affected too [~davsclaus] | Claus Ibsen:1481811973:15/Dec/16 14:26: Thanks its backported now"
